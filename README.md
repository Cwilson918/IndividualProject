<b>Project Statement<b>

Every fall I participate in multiple fantasy football drafts. One of which is a draft that is conducted offline. Over the past few years, we have tested out multiple different sites that could assist us in this process, instead of using pen and paper. Each site we have come across has had its positives and negatives, but none of which had all the tools we were looking for without an additional fee. My goal is to create a site that will be usuable for us over the next few years that contains all of the tools we are potentially looking for.
